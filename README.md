# Kernel Project:
This project has been seperated from the bootloader as I find it useful to have them seperate making it easier to modify this code to work with grub or some other bootloader.

# How to build:
ensure you C compiler installed then just simply run the `make` command. If make is not avaliable for your system you can always reproduce what the make file does in your systems command line to compile this project
